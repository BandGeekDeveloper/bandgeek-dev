### About ME

I have a diverse background that combines my previous studies in psychology with my current expertise in web development. This unique blend of knowledge allows me to approach projects with a deep understanding of human behavior and user experience, resulting in intuitive and engaging web applications.

### Skills

- Front-end Development: I excel in building interactive and responsive user interfaces using modern technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. React is my go-to framework for creating dynamic web experiences.

- Back-end Development: With NodeJS and Express, I construct scalable and efficient server-side applications. I have extensive experience in designing RESTful APIs and integrating them with various databases, including MongoDB.

- Database Management: MongoDB is my preferred NoSQL database, and I am well-versed in designing data models, performing CRUD operations, and optimizing database performance.

- Version Control and Deployment: I am proficient in using Git for version control, ensuring a streamlined collaborative development process. Additionally, I have experience deploying applications to cloud platforms like Heroku and AWS.
