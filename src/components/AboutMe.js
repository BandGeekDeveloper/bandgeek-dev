          When life give me lemons, I make lemonade. I'm not really here to talk
          about how tough life my life was or to prove that I didn't jave it
          easy, however everyone should know that it was an integral part about
          why I ended up a web developer. When I was in high school, I really
          had no idea with my life so I just joined the Marine Corps. I was at
          bootcamp less than 48 hours after my high school graduation. The same
          story is how I became a developer; again, after college I had no idea
          what I wanted to do with my life at that point and the rest is
          history.

          Two years ago I entered Awesome Inc's bootcamp and began my journey in
          full-stack web development, primarily dealing with the MERN Stack,
          primarily in the field of intricate data websites. Since then it has
          been a relentless pursue of education and self-improvement.

          My passions outside of tech include basketball, soccer, video games,
          nd music. I also love gaming with my forever gaming buddy, my fiancee,
          Mollie. We stay with our 3 beautiful children (2 cats, and a Guinea
          Pig) Yetta, Sampson, and Orissa. My ultimate goals are to set an
          example for other black people in tech, help people build the website
          of their dreams, learn as much as I possibly can, and look for ways to
          make learning in technology more accessible for those who don't have
          much. Feel free to explore my portfolio and have a little peek into
          who I am in my world where being a bandgeek and a developer converge.
